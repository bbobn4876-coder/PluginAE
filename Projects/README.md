# Projects Folder

This folder is used to store your presets and backgrounds that will be automatically loaded by the AEP Preview plugin.

## Supported File Types

- **`.jsx`** - ExtendScript files (presets, scripts)
- **`.gif`** - GIF animations (backgrounds, previews)

## How to Use

1. Place your `.jsx` and `.gif` files directly in this folder
2. The plugin will automatically scan and load these files when it starts
3. You can organize files in subfolders if needed
4. Refresh the plugin to see newly added files

## File Organization

```
Projects/
├── preset1.jsx
├── preset2.jsx
├── background1.gif
├── background2.gif
└── ...
```

## Notes

- Make sure your `.jsx` files are compatible with After Effects
- GIF files will be shown as preview thumbnails
- Large files may take longer to load
